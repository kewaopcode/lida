LuaJIT Interactive Disassembler

WORK IN PROGRESS. 

It's not interactive yet, but is still useful for some kind of protectors idk, the disassembler part is already quite correct, but it isn't so good at performance for large scripts (will be fixed later (the problem is usually the Instruction type, one instance of an instruction takes 120-140 bytes for AD and ABC schemes while the instruction encoded is always 4 bytes :) ))
